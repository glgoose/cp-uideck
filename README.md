# Clone Project: smash theme from UI deck

Goal: practise CSS/SASS & HTML

Based on screenshots of a theme (smash) from uideck.com we rebuild the layout.

## Repo naming
`CP-xxxx` **CP** stands for **Clone Project**  

Naming is borrowed from Star Wars where **C**lone **T**roopers are referred to by their number `CT-xxxx`, e.g. Rex is `CT-7567`  
Likewise my projects that are clones of existing apps/websites start there name with `CP-`
