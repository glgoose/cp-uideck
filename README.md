# Clone project: theme for fictional UIdeck.com

Goal: practise CSS/SASS & HTML

## Repo naming
`CT-xxxx` naming is borrowed from Star Wars where **CT** stands for **C**lone **T**rooper, e.g. Rex is `CT-7567`  
Likewise my projects that are clones of existing apps/websites start there name with `ct-`
